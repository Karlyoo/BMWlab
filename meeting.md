## 9/10
Ian suggested to study Summer's paper  this month,focusing in SMO and RIC. And if there's problem with it,I can ask for Tobby's or Ian's help.
For the Research Topic,it seems like there 's no one's topic is closed to the MIMO scheduling. So maybe I should focus on OAI first. And having a meeting with Prof later.

## 10/1
I ask Tobby for E2SM-KPM installation. And he mentioned that the gNB and RIC can not run in the same machine. So maybe I can install by myself one time,then cooperate with Henry and Richard(林孝陽) to finish this. 

Also Tobby and Richard gave us some advice for Eurecom Intership,including the neccessary document and the flight.

## 10/15
For the OAI gnb and [L] near RT RIC,I can use o-cloud OAI gnb by Nino to try to connect it. My next step is install it by Nino's installation guide.
And Johnson advices me to use OAI UE to confirm  and test the connection first.



## 11/10 meet with Ian:
-  Key Tasks and Goals
   - Duplicate Previous Work: The main objective is to replicate a task previously completed by "Summer" involving "automatic deployment" and "SMO" (Service Management and Orchestration).
   - Verify Data Collection: The immediate goal is to verify that data can be collected, regardless of the environment (VM, Docker, or Kubernetes).
  - Trello & Repository: All work must be placed in the "labs repository," and a hyperlink must be added to the corresponding "digital twin" action item on Trello (referred to as "trail log").
- Technical Issues & Workflow
  - Connection Problem: The listener is currently unable to connect to the "OAI" 5G core network, specifically the "OLG dot P" (likely OAI-GNB).
  - Documentation: The speaker provides detailed instructions on how to properly format documentation (referred to as "study notes") using Markdown, including how to format **shell commands**.

  - Development Environment:  Stop using the GitHub web interface and instead use Visual Studio Code to edit the "study notes" directly within the repository to work more efficiently.

- Deadlines
  - The current set of tasks must be completed before December.
