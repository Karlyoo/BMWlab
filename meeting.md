Ian suggested to study Summer's paper  this month,focusing in SMO and RIC. And if there's problem with it,I can ask for Tobby's or Ian's help.
For the Research Topic,it seems like there 's no one's topic is closed to the MIMO scheduling. So maybe I should focus on OAI first. And having a meeting with Prof later.
