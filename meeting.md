Ian suggested to study Summer's paper  this month,focusing in SMO and RIC. And if there's problem with it,I can ask for Tobby's or Ian's help.
For the Research Topic,it seems like there 's no one's topic is closed to the MIMO scheduling. So maybe I should focus on OAI first. And having a meeting with Prof later.

I ask Tobby for E2SM-KPM installation. And he mentioned that the gNB and RIC can not run in the same machine. So maybe I can install by myself one time,then cooperate with Henry and Richard(林孝陽) to finish this. 

Also Tobby and Richard gave us some advice for Eurecom Intership,including the neccessary document and the flight.
